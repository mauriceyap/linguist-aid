# Linguist Aid

We're helping to connect multi-lingual volunteers to mutual aid groups around the UK to provide free help with:

- translating leaflets, flyers and posters,
- interpreting for vulnerable people,
- chatting to people on the phone who feel alone and speak little or no English.

## Developing
